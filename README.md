# Improving Site Search with Clickthrough Data: A Simulated Analysis
Repository containing my MSci project, undertaken at the University of Glasgow, session 2012-2013. Supervised by [Dr Leif Azzopardi](https://www.leifos.me), I started to look at the world of Information Retrieval; specifically, the world of simulating searchers when interacting with a retrieval system.

## Abstract
Today, all major organisations have a presence on the World Wide Web. These websites typically host thousands of pages of content, and often provide a form of search functionality. This functionality acts as a fast and direct way for customers to find the information they are looking for to satisfy their information need. In this paper, we examine the problem of site search, focusing specifically on how organisations can incorporate usage data - as web search engines currently do - in order to improve retrieval quality. To this end, we propose three different ways to incorporate clickthrough data with a standard retrieval function. We then conduct a simulation generating clickthrough data to examine how the quantity and quality of the data affects retrieval performance. Our results show that with a large volume of low-noise clickthrough data, potential performance improvements are large. However, more realistic settings shows a modest improvement in performance. An increase of P@10 from 0.2 to 0.4 requires almost 2000 iterations where there is a high probability of clicking on a relevant item (0.64), and a low probability of clicking on irrelevant items (0.39).

## Further Information
This is a really interesting area that relies on a deep understanding of what people do when searching. Our understanding however is still quite limited, despite lots of interesting studies in this area. Indeed, [my PhD thesis](https://www.dmax.org.uk/thesis/) was about this particular topic!

This little project was my first foray into the (Interactive) Information Retrieval world; I learnt a lot about how to construct scientific apparatus (programs), how to conduct research (from reading papers, to designing experients, to analysing the results). I learnt a lot from Leif back then.

## Experimental Apparatus and Data
All my experimental apparatus and data files are archived on my personal filesystems -- they are too large to upload to GitHub. If you want them, let me know and we can arrange a way to share them.
